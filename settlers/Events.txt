Your opponent has been repeatedly attacking your patriotism, claiming that your party teaches that America is inherently racist. What is your response?
    A. The United States is the greatest country on Earth. I do not agree with those who would say that this country is tainted by racism.
    B. My opponent is right. This country is flawed, and when I am President, we will reckon with our own dark past.
    C. The true mark of a great nation is that it can accept its mistakes and better them in the future, and we are a great nation. We cannot hide from our own dark past.

Some progressives will be pleased with this answer, but this kind of talk scares most voters.
This is a good answer that pleases your base and appeals to your sense of patriotism. Some of your opponent's attacks still land, though.

A prominent Republican in Congress retweeted a video painting blue states as dangerous, dirty, and leeching off of "real" America. Will you hit back on this rhetoric?
    A. Push back on the facts. California has a historic budget surplus, and our cities are some of the most vibrant, diverse places in the world.
    B. This divisive rhetoric does nothing but stoke our partisan divisions. Unlike my opponent, I will be a President for *all* Americans.
    C. Republicans have it backwards. Our cities are our centers of production and culture, and rural America couldn't survive without them.
    D. Don't make this a campaign theme.

On Wednesday evening, a lone gunman took the lives of 3 people and injured 4 others in a park in Houston. Police have not given a motive. How do you respond?

A Representative from the left flank of your party attacked your flakiness on his signature climate and ecomomic policy package, claiming it reveals your true position of "neoliberal centrism". Do you clarify your positions?

A Democratic Senator from a red state disavowed some of your party's welfare policies, saying she doesn't want to turn America into an "entitlement society". What do you say in response?
    A. I stand by my party's welfare position. Perhaps the Senator would feel more at home in the same party as her junior colleague.
    B. I agree with the Senator. If we are going to stay competitive, we can't risk stymieing our growth with massive government spending.
    C. That's what Congress is for. When I'm President, I'll listen to all voices in our party.
    D. Do not respond.

Moderates and much of your base like this, but many progressives don't have much faith in Congress anymore.

At a town hall,  a voter asked you what you will do to protect manufacturing jobs that are being lost overseas. How do you respond?
    A. This is a natural consequence of economic development and globalization, which is a net positive. We can't expect the government to save every doomed industry.
    B. These losses are due to the development of our economy and they unfortunately canâ€™t be brought back, but we have a plan to retrain workers to get them back in the economy.
    C. We will be leaving several of the free trade agreements signed by previous administrations. These have caused irreconciliable damage to our towns and cities in the Heartland.
    D. As President, I will end our disastrous trade deals and close off our borders to ensure that these jobs are going to good, hard-working Americans.

This answer will not go over well in the Rust Belt, but seems like common sense to much of liberal America. 
This answer plays to protectionist voters in the Rust Belt. 
This answer plays to a conservative base and to voters in the Rust Belt, but will hurt your popularity in much of the rest of the country.

It has been several years since the COVID-19 Pandemic ravaged the United States. At a campaign event, an attendee asks you how you will prevent new outbreaks around the country.
    A. I will listen to both public health experts and economists. There is a balance to be struck between common sense measures and overcaution.
    B. We need to engage in targeted lockdowns at home and send vaccines out to the poorer parts of the world. Every infection is a new vector for new variants to arise.
    C. This is the United States of America! We can't let a virus control our lives! As President, I will issue an executive order banning lockdowns and vaccine mandates nationwide.
    D. As far as I'm concerned, the pandemic is over among vaccinated Americans. If you've chosen not to get vaccinated, I will not punish those who have with further lockdowns.

    A. Take a test and release the results. I'm happy to prove them wrong.
    B. Question their own mental abilities and promise to take the test if they do first.
    C. This is ridiculous. My opponent knows they can't win on the issues, so they're resorting to petty personal insults.
    D. Don't respond.
A|0|0|0|0|0|-0.5

There has been a stark increase in the number of migrants detained at the southern border. The media is calling it a crisis, and voters are asking how you will deal with it.
    A. Travel to Texas and meet with border patrol agents, and reaffirm your committment to keeping America's borders safe in a humane fashion. (This will use up one of your rallies.)

This will greatly harm you among conservatives, and will please progressives and immigration advocates.
This idea is pretty unpopular nationally. Conservatives are thrilled, however.

Puerto Rico has been hit by a devastating hurricane in yet another intense season, and left without power for several days.

At the start of this decade, the country suffered inflation after the supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic. At a town hall event, a voter asks you how you will prevent this from happening again.
    A. We need to radically rethink how our global economy works. Relying on countries halfway across the world for our economy to function is not sustainable - the United States should control its own supply chain.
    B. We need to make sure we are prepared for the next global catastrophe, whatever it may be. I will invest in global early-warning systems for diseases and natural disasters, so we can stop the next disruption before it starts.
    C. I will make sure Americans are consuming and producing American goods. China released the pandemic on the world, and we can't trust them to keep our economy running.
    D. I will make it easier for goods to come into our country by easing trade barriers and repealing the Jones Act. A smooth and efficient supply chain means cheaper prices for everyday Americans.

17
On Friday night, China engaged in one of the largest incursions into Taiwanese airspace in history, and news outlets are speculating about an impending invasion. What is your take on this?
    A. I will not send Americans halfway across the world to die for another country. We will take measures to protect our national interests, but I will not risk World War 3 over Taiwan.
    B. Taiwan is a vital ally, and American credibility on the world stage would crumble if we didn't step in to protect them. When I am President, we will not tolerate Chinese incursions into Taiwan.
    C. Our military is decaying, our ships and fighter jets often decades out of date. We need to match China's rapid militarization to demonstrate that we are prepared for war, should it come to that.
    D. President Xi is threatened by Taiwan because it demonstrates that Chinese democracy is possible. We cannot let an authoritarian rival crush a flourishing, independent, democratic state.
